# ReLive - Web view

Web application for viewing ReLive sessions on the desktop (written in Angular). Note: Must be hosted on the same server as the ReLive-Server!

## Setup
Run `npm install`, then `npm start`. Server should be reachable on `localhost:4200`. For a static build, run `npm install && npm run build`, then host the `dist` directory with a webserver (e.g., nginx / apache).
